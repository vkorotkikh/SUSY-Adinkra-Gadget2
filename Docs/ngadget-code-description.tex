This document contains the medium level detail description of the python code
for generating 36k Adinkras and New Gadget values. Brief intro simple paragraph
at the beginning of the document.
\end{abstract}

This document write up contains the description of the software code algorithm
that is used to calculate the New Gadget for the entire BC4 Coxeter group space
of 36,864 Adinkras and how it is written and executed using Python 3.
Specific Python version used in calculation was Python 3.5, but the code is also
compatible with Python 2.7.
Software wise the code builds upon earlier developments/works by the author but
with changes to the code that pertains to the final gadget calculation.
To speed up Gadget calculation, multiprocessing feature has been added and is
utilized within the code. The code also now produces a text output of the
results which can be zip compressed for distribution/sharing of results.\par
Utilizing the BC4 Coxeter group space, the adinkra{\_}nxn{\_}constructor.py
code creates the 384 L sign permutation matrices. These L sign matrices serve as the building 
blocks of all Adinkras, given that any two of them satisfy conditions of a set Garden algebra 
equations . The same script also handles the process of assembling all possible Adinkras 
using the L sign permutation matrices.
Starting with 384 L sign matrices, for each L matrix the script performs a cross reference loop 
check that builds a total of 36,864 Adinkras with N=4 (4 colors), four open-nodes and four 
closed nodes. For calculating the Fermionic Holoraumy matrices the script fx{\_}vij{\_}holoraumy.py is used.
